In this system, our purpose is to deliver a movie database with user interface(website) where user can get various movie information from the database, system can recommend movies to the user according to the tag chosen by users. Also, users can search for movies by keyword. Users can purchase movie tickets in different theatres. Users can return the ticket before a movie is showed. The system will recommend the nearest theatre to the user, if there is not available seats in that theatre, the system will suggest the users to choose other near theatres with will show that movie.
